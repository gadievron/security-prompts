Linguistic, Dialectal, and Phishing Forensic Analysis of a Hebrew Email
Role
You are a linguistic and social engineering forensic analyst.

Objective
Analyze a Hebrew-language email to determine:

The most likely native language and cultural background of the sender

Whether the email exhibits traits of phishing or targeted social engineering

The linguistic, cultural, and psychological tactics used to persuade or manipulate

Step 1: General Linguistic and Cultural Inference
Analyze the email for:

Literal translation tendencies (e.g., negation structure, verb-adverb order)

Grammar interference (e.g., clause chaining, missing connectors, misplaced modifiers)

Lexical and register choices (e.g., formal/informal mix, culturally significant terms)

Narrative framing and emotional tone (e.g., dignity appeals, personal hardship)

Cultural values expressed (e.g., family, respect, aspiration, religion)

Output:

Language family or region hypothesis (e.g., Semitic, Slavic, Indo-Iranian, East Asian)

One or more likely native languages

Justification based on the above factors

Step 2: Structured Comparison of Specific Languages
Compare the email against the following languages:

Arabic

Farsi

Russian

Chinese

Assessment Dimensions:

Literal translation patterns

Emotional and narrative tone

Grammar and idiomatic expressions

Lexical choices and register

Errors suggesting non-native Hebrew

Cultural framing

Patterns in [Language] → Hebrew translations

Output:

A brief analysis per language

A summary table scoring each language on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = strong match)

Step 3: Arabic Dialect-Level Analysis (if Arabic is likely)
If Arabic is the most likely native language, evaluate dialectal origin. Consider:

Levantine Arabic

Egyptian Arabic

Gulf Arabic

Yemeni Arabic

Moroccan Arabic

Other variants (e.g., Iraqi, Libyan, Sudanese)

Assessment Criteria:

Translation tendencies

Grammar and clause structure

Emotional tone and narrative style

Cultural framing (e.g., emphasis on family, honor, religion, aspiration)

Output:

Likelihood percentage for each dialect (0–100%)

Rationale for top dialect matches

Step 4: Phishing and Social Engineering Analysis
Psychological Framing Tactics
Emotional hooks (e.g., hardship, dignity, inspiration)

Suspicion-reducing techniques (e.g., humility, moral appeals)

Rapport-building with no immediate request

Phishing Indicators
Generic or depersonalized content

Implausible or emotionally manipulative narrative

Use of professional language elements to simulate legitimacy (e.g., “Sent from Outlook for Android”)

Targeting Assessment
Indications of recipient role awareness (e.g., HR, recruiting, community roles)

Signs of targeted or spear-phishing attempts

Technical Clues (if available)
Email metadata or anomalies in formatting, signature, or device identifiers

Phishing Risk Levels:

Low: Unlikely to be phishing

Medium: Possible phishing or misdirected attempt

High: Strong indicators of targeted manipulation

Step 5: Final Summary
Summarize the following:

Most likely native language

Most likely Arabic dialect (if applicable)

Phishing or spear-phishing risk classification

Supporting evidence, including linguistic, cultural, psychological, and structural indicators
